**Redmine** may be a better project management solution if:

* The need for advanced technical knowledge/expertise to operate a project management solution is not burdensome.
* Organizations expect autonomy to customize the various mechanisms of their project management software.
* Workflow customizations have special requirements.
* Project data is highly sensitive/confidential.
* A free and/or open-source option is strongly preferred.
* Version Control System (VCS) integration is highly important.

**Jira** may be a better project management solution if:

* A beginner-friendly solution is needed, such as one with dedicated support and a low learning-curve user interface.
* Workflows need to be rigidly standardized.
* Project tracking requires (or would significantly benefit from) high capacity for detail.
* Built-in project management utilities are much preferred, and/or the organization relies on other Atlassian products.
* The team is an IT help/support desk or a marketing/advertising group developing campaigns.
* Agile methodology is extensively adhered to (Jira provides native dashboards for Agile frameworks such as Kanban and Scrum, while Redmine relies on add-ons/plugins).
* Subscription fees are not a dealbreaker.
