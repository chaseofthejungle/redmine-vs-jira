*Redmine* may be a better project management solution if:

* Organizations expect autonomy over the various mechanisms of their project management software.
* Workflow customizations have special requirements.
* Project data is highly sensitive/confidential.
* Budgeting is tight, or a free option is otherwise strongly preferred.
* Version Control System (VCS) integration is highly important.

*Jira* may be a better project management solution if:

* Workflows need to be rigidly standardized.
* Project tracking requires (or would significantly benefit from) high capacity for detail.
* Built-in/native project management tools/utilities would be much preferred.
* The team is an IT help/support desk or a marketing/advertising group developing campaigns.
* Agile methodology is championed.
