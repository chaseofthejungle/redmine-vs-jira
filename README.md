**Redmine** may be a better project management solution if:

* Organizations expect autonomy in customizing the various mechanisms of their project management software (including data and hosting).
* The need for advanced technical knowledge/expertise to operate a project management solution is not burdensome.
* Workflow customizations have special requirements.
* Project data is highly sensitive/confidential.
* A free and/or open-source option is strongly preferred.
* Version Control System (VCS) integration is highly important.

*Who's using Redmine?:* Government agencies, academic institutions, healthcare organizations, open-source driven communities, and software companies that largely handle their needs on-premises.

**Jira** may be a better project management solution if:

* A polished and beginner-friendly solution is needed, such as one with dedicated support and a low learning-curve user interface.
* Workflows need to be rigidly standardized.
* Project tracking requires (or would significantly benefit from) high capacity for detail, including in-depth analytics.
* Projects need to be set up quickly and have potential to scale highly (including to multiple departments).
* Built-in project management utilities are much preferred, and/or the organization relies on other Atlassian products.
* Agile methodology is extensively adhered to (Jira provides native dashboards for Agile frameworks such as Kanban and Scrum, while Redmine relies on add-ons/plugins).
* Subscription fees are not a dealbreaker.
  
*Who's using Jira?:* Agile developers, enterprises, IT help/support desks, and marketing, advertising, and various other creative and directly business-oriented departments.
